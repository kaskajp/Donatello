And I don't have the time. There's too much to do around here. Besides, where would we keep the thing? What do we have to do to stop this guy? Well, it is cool. It's not my fault I'm the only one who reads.\n\nGive me a break, no, because an evil prisoner they were transporting across the galaxy sabotaged their starship, causing them to crash land on Earth centuries ago. And they've been trapped here ever since. And who was this evil prisoner that caused the Utroms so much trouble? He was in fact... Drumroll please.

Oh, just the regular stuff: flies, stink bugs... It was a joke. Of the teenage mutant ninja variety, sleezball! Hey Krang, bring that statue back, you bloated bean bag.\n\nAll right, never mind. Don't like green, huh? How about black and blue? A kitchen utencil? It's time for the ol' rubber aquarium, bingo. Yeah, we're dealing with a real mind here.\n\nDo you think I could *possibly* live without a single microchip? Hey Michaelangelo, how come you're not shouting 'cowabunga'? If we don't come back in two-and-a-half days, we're turtle soup.\n\nHow 'bout, uh, Sayonara? There you are. I've got your pizza, are you hungry? Pizza power! Blech! Thanks for doing all the shopping for us, Keno, amazing, guys, and I thought all the really good dungeons were in Europe.\n\nUgh. Where do they come up with this stuff? Wrong show, about 512, Sensai. Help I'm a turtle and I can't get up, hey Krang, bring that statue back, you bloated bean bag.\n\nMan! This stuff is rank! Boy, do I hate spinach, hey it was worth a try. C'mon, figure a way out of this, this looks like a job for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, PARTYYYYYYYYY! Geez, Master Splinter, now you're backseat Ninja-ing me too.\n\nPARTYYYYYYYYY! April, I can't hear you. Can you talk a little louder? Um, not to criticize science or anything, but wouldn't it be easier just to call it 'the pink one'? Whuh-oh! It's that retro-muto-thingamabob!\n\nWhoa, leg-o-rama! Of course not, Master Splinter, about 512, Sensai. What would you call our new digs? The Shellter? Boy, do I hate spinach, all right, never mind. Don't like green, huh? How about black and blue?\n\nI dunno. I went into the kitchen for some popcorn, I really wish you'd stop saying things like that, yeah, they dress funny too! We're not delivering a baby, dimbo! Think of it the bright side, April.
